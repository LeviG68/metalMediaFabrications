            Hello!  
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My name is Jansen, owner of Metal Media Fabrication in Missoula, Montana.  I have 20 years experience in the welding/fabrication industry, and I have been a Certified Welding Inspector (CWI) since 2005. Building a product that puts a smile on the customer’s face has always been my main motivator. If you can dream it, I can build it.  Whether it’s steel handrail, custom furniture, trailer repair/modification, or anything in between. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Let’s talk!
            </p>
